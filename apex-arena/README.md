# APEX ARENA

**STAKE. EXECUTE. DOMINATE.**

A minimal, **front‑only** version of the Apex Bounty vision. No backend, no Replit, no API — it just runs.

## Open the site (2 steps)

```bash
cd apex-arena
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your browser should open to **http://localhost:5173**. If it doesn’t, open that URL yourself.

- **Landing** — Hero, STAKE / EXECUTE / DOMINATE, Enter the Arena / View Bounties  
- **Bounties** — Placeholder board (hook up your backend later)  
- **Footer** — Terms of Sovereignty, Privacy, Disclaimers  

All content is static so the page always loads. High-contrast, cosmic-style background, gold accents.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then open the URL Vite prints (e.g. http://localhost:4173).

## Your vision

- Arena: operators, stakes, bounties, burn  
- Legal: Terms of Sovereignty (GMSA), Privacy, Disclaimers (Australia + worldwide)  
- Standalone: no Replit required  

This repo is the **new** site that actually opens. Connect Profit-Engine-1 (or any API) later when you’re ready.
